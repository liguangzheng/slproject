### How to get the SLProject

The SLProject is hosted at GitHub as a GIT repository.
[GIT](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed versioning control system.

The SLProject contains some GIT submodules. 
To clone all at once you need to clone recursively.
You can clone recursively either with the GitHub GUI-Tool or with the following command in the console:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cpvrlab/SLProject.git
cd SLProject
```

For detailed build instructions on various platforms go to the [SLProject wiki](https://github.com/cpvrlab/SLProject/wiki).
